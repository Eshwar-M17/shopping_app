## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows a Clean Architecture approach with a clear separation of concerns:

```
lib/
  core/              # Core utilities, constants, and reusable components
    constants/       # App-wide constants
    theme/           # Theme configuration
    utils/           # Utility functions and classes
    widgets/         # Reusable UI components
  features/          # Feature modules
    catalogue/       # Product catalogue feature
      data/          # Data layer with API integration
      domain/        # Business logic & entities
      presentation/  # UI components & state management
    cart/            # Shopping cart feature
      data/
      domain/
      presentation/
  main.dart          # Application entry point
```

This architecture provides:
- **Testability** - Independent layers that can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability** - Clear boundaries between components
- **Scalability** - Easy addition of new features without affecting existing code
