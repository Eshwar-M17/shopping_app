## ‚ú® Implemented Features

- **Product Catalogue** - Browse through products with efficient pagination
- **Detailed Product Pages** - View product details, specifications, and images
- **Shopping Cart** - Add, remove, and update quantities with real-time price calculations
- **Discount System** - Automatic discount calculations based on product pricing rules
- **Responsive UI Components** - Basic responsive design for different screen sizes
- **Error Handling** - Basic error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Null Safety** - Null-safe code with safe getters for API responses

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows a Clean Architecture approach with a clear separation of concerns:

```
lib/
  core/              # Core utilities, constants, and reusable components
    constants/       # App-wide constants
    theme/           # Theme configuration
    utils/           # Utility functions and classes
    widgets/         # Reusable UI components
  features/          # Feature modules
    catalogue/       # Product catalogue feature
      data/          # Data layer with API integration
      domain/        # Business logic & entities
      presentation/  # UI components & state management
    cart/            # Shopping cart feature
      data/
      domain/
      presentation/
  main.dart          # Application entry point
```

This architecture provides:
- **Maintainability** - Clear boundaries between components
- **Scalability** - Easy addition of new features without affecting existing code

## üöÄ Performance Features

Current optimizations in the app include:

- **Widget Structure** - Breaking down widgets into smaller, focused components
- **Const Constructors** - Strategic use of const constructors where applicable
- **Pagination** - Efficient product loading with pagination
- **Image Caching** - Using CachedNetworkImage for optimized image loading
- **Component Reusability** - Reusing common UI components across the app

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **State Management**: [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) for state management
- **Navigation**: [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) for declarative routing
- **Network & API**: [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for API integration
- **Image Handling**: [CachedNetworkImage](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) for image loading and caching
- **Dependency Injection**: Provider pattern for simple dependency management
- **UI Framework**: Material Design components

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

Current error handling implementation includes:

- **API Error Handling** - Basic handling of network errors
- **Null Safety** - Implementation of Dart's null safety features
- **Safe Getters** - Custom getters to safely access potentially null data
- **Error Widgets** - Basic error UI components with retry options

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0 or higher)
