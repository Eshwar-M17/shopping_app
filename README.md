## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows a Clean Architecture approach with a clear separation of concerns:

```
lib/
  core/              # Core utilities, constants, and reusable components
    constants/       # App-wide constants
    theme/           # Theme configuration
    utils/           # Utility functions and classes
    widgets/         # Reusable UI components
  features/          # Feature modules
    catalogue/       # Product catalogue feature
      data/          # Data layer with API integration
      domain/        # Business logic & entities
      presentation/  # UI components & state management
    cart/            # Shopping cart feature
      data/
      domain/
      presentation/
  main.dart          # Application entry point
```

This architecture provides:
- **Testability** - Independent layers that can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability** - Clear boundaries between components
- **Scalability** - Easy addition of new features without affecting existing code

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

The app includes numerous performance optimizations:

- **Widget Composition** - Breaking down complex widgets into smaller, focused components
- **Const Constructors** - Extensive use of const constructors to minimize rebuilds
- **Lazy Loading** - Efficient pagination with lazy loading for product lists
- **Image Caching** - Optimized image loading with proper caching strategies
- **Memoization** - Pre-computing values outside build methods to reduce repeated calculations
- **Efficient UI Updates** - Strategic widget rebuilds only when necessary
- **Optimized Error Handling** - Graceful error handling with minimal UI disruption
- **Custom JSON Serialization** - Robust handling of API responses with null safety
- **Smart Resource Management** - Proper cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **State Management**: [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) for efficient, testable state management
- **Navigation**: [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) for declarative routing
- **Network & API**: [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) and [Retrofit](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit) for type-safe API integration
- **Image Handling**: [CachedNetworkImage](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) for efficient image loading and caching
- **Data Classes**: [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for immutable data models
- **Dependency Injection**: Simple service locator pattern for dependency management
- **UI Framework**: Material 3 Design components for a modern look and feel

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

The app implements comprehensive error handling strategies:

- **API Error Handling** - Graceful handling of network errors with user-friendly messages
