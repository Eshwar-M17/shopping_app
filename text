We have built a Flutter shopping cart application that uses Riverpod for state management and follows a clean architecture approach (data, domain, and presentation layers). However, I need to ensure that the code is optimized, modular, scalable, and maintainable with robust error handling, using techniques I'm already familiar with as an intermediate developer.

Please review and modify the existing code to achieve the following goals:

1. **Optimization:**
   - Ensure efficient use of Flutter widgets (e.g., using ListView.builder, const constructors, minimal rebuilds).
   - Optimize performance by caching images (using CachedNetworkImage or similar) and reducing unnecessary widget rebuilds.
   - Make sure state updates are efficient and don’t cause excessive re-renders.

2. **Modularity and Scalability:**
   - Break down large widgets into smaller, reusable components.
   - Organize code into well-defined layers (data, domain, presentation) following clean architecture principles.
   - Use proper separation of concerns, keeping business logic out of the UI code.
   - Ensure the code structure is easy to understand and extend for future features.

3. **Maintainability:**
   - Refactor code for clarity and consistency (naming conventions, proper comments, and documentation).
   - Remove any redundant code and ensure all logic is properly encapsulated in functions or classes.
   - Use basic dependency injection (if applicable) with simple techniques that I’m comfortable with.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling for API calls and other asynchronous operations.
   - Use try-catch blocks to capture errors and display user-friendly error messages or fallback UI.
   - Ensure that loading and error states are managed cleanly with Riverpod.

5. **Intermediate-Level Techniques:**
   - Please use only standard, intermediate-level Flutter and Dart practices without introducing overly advanced techniques that may complicate understanding.
   - Ensure that the modifications are explained clearly and use coding patterns and methods I am already familiar with.

Review the entire codebase and make the necessary changes so that the final product is optimized, modular, scalable, and maintainable, with proper error handling in place.

Begin by analyzing the current implementation and suggest modifications where needed. Then, provide the updated code snippets or instructions to implement these improvements.
